# Entity Layer

This layer is defined to represent our entities of application.  
Entities are the abstract datas that we are proccessing in
entire application such as User, Company and their sub entities.
These abstract datas are seperated into bunch of datas such as 
String, integer, float etc. We are defining entities to collect 
and classify which data belongs to which type of data.
Simple integer does not mean anything but if it is inside of User
entity or another entity, we can guess what does this data stands
for and what are we using it for
